'''
Here I have to first separate the string into two lists, one containing all the letters and the other containing all the digits. Then, i can determine if it is possible to reformat the string by checking if the absolute difference between the lengths of the two lists is less than or equal to 1. If it is not possible to reformat the string, i return an empty string. Otherwise, i can create the reformatted string by alternating between characters from the two lists, starting with the list that has more elements.
